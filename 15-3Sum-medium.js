// Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

// Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.



// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
// Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
// Explanation: 
// nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
// nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
// nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
// The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
// Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
// Example 2:

// Input: nums = [0,1,1]
// Output: []
// Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
// Example 3:

// Input: nums = [0,0,0]
// Output: [[0,0,0]]
// Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.
